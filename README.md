Things that still need to be done

Write up clues(just steal the answers and clues from an easy/moderate 3x4 puzzle on logic-puzzle.org)

Create the lables(use HBox for the horizontal labels and VBox for the vertical lables, should be created in the puzzle class
and called in the MainController class)

Write the methods for the buttons, the handle events have already been written in the MainController but the 
methods don't do anything yet.

Write the checkAnswers method in both the Block and the Puzzle class
